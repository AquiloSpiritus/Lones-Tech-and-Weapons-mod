 Tweaks for the game

Hello! When you go to add my mod to your game it will seperate Translocator gates, and Wearable UPS into its own mod folder seperate
from lones tweaks. It will look like this. 


Lones tweaks
Wearable UPS
Translocator gates

This is to make it easier to not add anything you may not want. Simply don't select the mod in world gen!

Thanks to the many people that have helped me with making the items in this mod. 

Chaovolt for helping me with code stuff for real. 
Kenan for ideas, and also helping me with code.
SzQ for ideas 
and others!
